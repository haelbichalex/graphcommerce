  /**
   * Build flags are used to enable/disable features during build time.
   *
   * - Build flags are only available during build time and all values are inlined in the build
   *   output. Setting these values at runtime will have no effect.
   * - Build flags allow 'three shaking' for code that is not used, allow to reduce bundle size.
   *
   * ### Configuring build flags
   *
   * In your `next.config.js` you can configure your build flags:
   *
   * ```ts
   * const withGraphCommerce = configure({ buildFlags: { advancedFilters: true })
   * ```
   *
   * ### Configuring via .env file
   *
   * You can also configure build flags via a `.env` file. This is useful for CI/CD environments.
   *
   * ```bash
   * BUILD_FLAG_ADVANCED_FILTERS = 1
   * ```
   *
   * ### Using your build flags
   *
   * ```ts
   * if (process.env.BUILD_FLAG_ADVANCED_FILTERS) {
   *   // do something
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Next.js will replace process.env.BUILD_FLAG_ADVANCED_FILTERS with `'1'` or `undefined` at build
   * time. Trying to destructure process.env variables won't work due to the nature of webpack
   * DefinePlugin.
   *
   * #### Creating your own build flags
   *
   * To declare a new build flag 'myBuildFlag', add a new entry to the `NodeJS.ProcessEnv` interface
   * in your `types.d.ts`:
   *
   * ```ts
   * declare namespace NodeJS {
   *   export interface ProcessEnv {
   *     BUILD_FLAG_MY_BUILD_FLAG: '1' | undefined
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Note: Currently it is not possible to pass any other type than `'1' | undefined` to the build
   * flags. If you want to define configuration that is a configuration use NEXT_PUBLIC_.
